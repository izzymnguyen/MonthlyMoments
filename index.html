                        Hi there! Welcome to Monthly Moments! My name is Isabelle Nguyen, creator of this website!<br>
                        
                        Now you may be wondering... what is Monthly Moments?<br>
                        <br>
                        Monthly Moments is a video blog aka a vlog project that is meant to document the many special memories 2025 has in store for me!<br>
                        Each month I will be filming small mini vlogs and taking photos whenever I am out and about so that by the end of the year I can look<br>
                        back and see what all has happened. At the end of each year, I will invite my friends to watch a year end compilation that will feature<br>
                        them and all the amazing memories we’ve made!<br>
                        <br>
                        It’ll be fun!<br>
                        
                        Everything on this was made by yours truly :) ME IZZY<br>
                        
                        So have fun watching and looking through my life as you interact with this website, which was made by ME!!<br>
                        <br>
                        ❤️Love, Isabelle (aka Izzy)
