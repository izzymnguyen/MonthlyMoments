            Hi! Welcome to the first pilot video for the website! A project I've been working on for a little bit now! 2024 has been a growing year. A year of being thankful for what I have and for having such an amazing support system. It's taught me how to be confident in myself and to live life to its fullest.
            The video doesn't dictate how much has happened this year. Sorry if you weren't able to make it in the montage but know that even though there wasn't any captured memories that just mean I was enjoying living in the moment and simply forgot.
        
            <br><br>
            This year I've learned to be an academic god, graduated with a Bachelors in Computer Science, and started my first job as a Data Engineer. Not only that but went clubbing for the first time, starting up dancing on my own, performing for K-Move, traveled to different states in the US, the list goes on and on!
            2024 is definately a year I'll remember! Thank you all for accepting who I am and just making my life 100x more enjoyable. 2024 was definately a hard year but I was able to make it through it. I've never been more thankful for a year because a lot has happened. 
            <br><br>
            Moving on to the video, the pilot video is simply just a recap of 2024 and all the captured video memories. Each month of 2025, I will post a little highlight clip and a summary of how that month went. In the future I aim to had a slot of photos, but due to just pure laziness that feature hasn't been made yet.
            <br>
            I can't wait to show you guys all the amazing memories I've had with you and I hope you enjoy watching these videos as much as I enjoy making this project. 
            <br><br>❤️ Love, Izzy 
            <br><br>
