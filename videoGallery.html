                    Hello! Better late than never :) This is January's recap post where I really don't remember what I did. In terms of January, a lot of events happened I learned a total of 0.75 dances, what does that mean... I never finished learning it.
                    The song I was learning was IZNA by IZNA a group from the the reality competition show called i-land2. The reason I never finished the dance, was just mainly because I got too lazy... talk about great motiviation there. 
        
                    <br>
                    Next here are some random events that have happen in January:
                    <br>
                    In January, I bought myself a duck snowball to which I have yet to make because the snow has been super flaky and not sticky. I'm kind of disappointed in that. Next I redid my RGB lights on my PC set up because of my poor electrical work,
                    the lights were being short circuited. I also bought cheap ones so it was bound to be a goner soon or later. I had enough to add the RBG my monitor so now all lighting is one color (YAY FOR ME). Moving on, I've been thinking about redying my hair
                    specifically red... will I do that.. NO. Why? Because my hair is dead and I think it's time to go back to my natural hair color for the time being. I've recently bought a hair mask from the Asia Mall call Fimo and it's been useful for the time being,
                    although it is an added step to the hair care routine. BUT it makes my hair soft so I don't mind.
                    <br>
                        <br>
                    Nothing too much else happend but I did get to spend time with a bunch of friends. Jennfier, Tram, and I took Tet photos at Landmark center this year dressing up in our Ao Dai and with the help of Trisha she was wiling to take our photos for us. THANK YOU TRISHA!
                    I've also got time to hang out with a few older friends like Claire where we made Omaru Rice (homemade) and it was really tasty! She's A CHEF!! While also introducing my friend Louis to Pho as well. Lots of things happened and it was a good month. I happy :)
                    <br><br>
                    OH one last thing CHUC MUNG NAM MOI! Happy Lunar New Years!! The year of the snake!
